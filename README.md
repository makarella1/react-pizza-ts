<h3>Little conclusion</h3>
<strong>Great project overall. It introduced me to TypeScript so I can't complain. Well, there was an extremely weird markup without any responsiveness,
 so I had to rewrite everything in CSS-modules. Yeah, boring and exhausting, yet quite useful experience, in addition I got a pretty cool design. As far as
 TypeScript is concerned, I definitely liked it! It's like a sensei who's keeping you under his bar and smacks you as soon as you try to do something wrong,
 amazing! I'll use TypeScript in my future projects without a doubt!
